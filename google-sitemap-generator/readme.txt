##      Description:  Creates a Sitemap for Google of your topics, your forums, and your board.
##
##   Affected files:  None
##
##       Affects DB:  No
##
##            Notes:  This does not submit the sitemap to Google, you must do that
##                    Also, Google only looks at 50k URLs at once, so if you have more than
##                    50k topics + forums, you need to modify this mod a little.
